# Database Schema

TypeScript type definitions for the [@pseinfo database](https://github.com/pseinfo/database).

**Status:** Elements only. Compounds, nuclides, minerals planned for later versions.

## Architecture

The main `Database` type exposes all major entities (elements, chemical compounds, nuclides, etc.) as well as technically necessary components such as references (standardized citation management) and a flexible physical unit system.

### Core

### Units & References
